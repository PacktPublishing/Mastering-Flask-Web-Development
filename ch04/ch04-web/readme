Project Name: Online Complaint Management System (OCMS)
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype is a web-based complaint system that tends to   
     accept, manage, and respond to user feedback for a generic customer service module. The goal is to showcase essential external Flask modules that provide optimized performance, faster implementation, and more secure transactions than its base equivalent.

     This project uses the Blueprint approach in managing the project directories.
========================================================================

A. Project Directory

--- ch04-web (main project directory)
      --- modules  - contains all the Blueprint modules and their respective components, 
                        such API endpoint functions, repository, and services
               - contains the forms directory that contains Flask-WTF form models for web forms 
      --- cache_dir - contains all cache files created by Flask-Caching module
      --- flask_session - contains Flask-Session session files
      --- migrations - contains alembic and all Flask-Migration related files

      --- model - contains model classes and database configurations
      --- pages - supposedly for error pages
      --- resources - supposedly for generic static files

B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage

    --- mail_config.py - provides the Flask-Mail instance
    --- main_cache.py - provides the Flask-Caching instance
    --- manage.py - provides the Flask-Migrate implementation and setup
    
C. Database Configurations
   db_dump - contains the ocms.sql dump file, which contains dummy test data
           - database platform is PostgreSQL 

D. Dependencies
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch04-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency files
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

E. Running the application:
   --- Generate first the PostgreSQL table schema using the following Flask-Migrate commands:
         1. python -m flask --app manage.py db init
         2. python -m flask --app manage.py db migrate -m "Initial migration."
         3. python -m flask --app manage.py db upgrade
            python -m flask --app manage.py db downgrade (if schema needs update but modify the run_migrations_****() in env.py if necessary)

   --- Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch04-env.
