Project Name: Online Grocery Application (OGA)
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype is a small-scale API-based e-commerce application 
       for a grocery store. It has the typical ordering, purchasing, inventory, 
       and user management modules.

      The application will use uWSGI to run the application.
     
      The application uses the Blueprint and Application Factory design approaches in managing its source codes and directories..
========================================================================

A. Project Directory
--- ch11-uwsgi (main project directory)
      --- app  - contains all the modules and their respective components, 
                        such API endpoint functions and repository
               - contains the model directory that contains database 
                 configuration and model classes of the Peewee ORM
               - contains the __init__.py file which is the heart of the
                 application

      --- main.py - imports the create_app() from app/__init__.py and manages the database connectivity

B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage
        
C. Database Configurations
   db_dump - contains the ogs.sql dump file, which contains dummy test data
           - database platform is PostgreSQL 

D. Dependencies
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch11-guni-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency files
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

E. Running the application:
   --- Generate first the PostgreSQL table schema using the following Peewee-Migrations commands:
         1. pem init
         2. pem add app.models.db.Login
            pem add app.models.db.Administrator
            pem add app.models.db.Category
            ...
            ...
         2. pem watch
         3. pem migrate
          
   --- To run the application, run the command:
      uwsgi --http 127.0.0.1:8000 --master -p 4 -w main:app --enable-threads
