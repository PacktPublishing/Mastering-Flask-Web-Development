Project Name: Vaccine Reporting Management System (VRMS) - Encrypted SQLAlchemy, HTTPS, Form Validation and Sanitation, Sessions, and X-Response
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype is about an online application that gathers data 
       from vaccine patients and generates reports from that information. 
       The raw application manages vaccine, patient, doctor, administration, 
       and login details.

       This application is a specimen on applying Encrypted SQLAlchemy on login table
       form validation, input sanitation, storing data in sessions,
       and securing the application using HTTPS.
       user passwords used for login authentication.

       The application uses the Application Factory design approach in managing 
       its source codes and directories.

A. Project Directory
--- ch09-web-passphrase (main project directory)
      --- modules  - contains all the view modules and their respective components, 
                        such the Jinja templates, repository, and services
               - contains the model directory that contains database 
                 configuration and model classes
               - contains the __init__.py file which is the heart of the
                 application, contains all the configurations and creation
                 of Flask instance
      --- migrations - contains alembic and all Flask-Migration related files
      --- flask_session - contains the session files of Flask-Session
      --- main.py - imports the create_app() from app/__init__.py, 
                    utilizes X-headers for securing the server response, and
                    configuring the HTTPS protocol
      --- tests - contains PyTest files for testing Flask components

B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage
    --- cert.pem/key.pem - contains the keys for configuring the HTTPS protocol
    --- manage.py - provides the Flask-Migrate implementation and setup
    
C. Database Configurations
   db_dump - contains the vrms_enc.sql dump file, which contains dummy test data
           - database platform is PostgreSQL 

D. Dependencies
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch09-web-passphrase-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency files
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

E. Running the application:
    --- Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch09-web-passphrase-env.
