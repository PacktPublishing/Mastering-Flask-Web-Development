Project Name: Vaccine Reporting Management System (VRMS) - Bcrypt
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype is about an online application that gathers data 
       from vaccine patients and generates reports from that information. 
       The raw application manages vaccine, patient, doctor, administration, 
       and login details.

       This application is a specimen on applying bcrypt module in securing 
       user passwords used for login authentication.

       The application uses the Application Factory design approach in managing 
       its source codes and directories.
========================================================================

A. Project Directory
--- ch09-api-bcrypt (main project directory)
      --- modules  - contains all the API modules and their respective components, 
                        such API endpoint functions, repository, and services
               - contains the model directory that contains database 
                 configuration and model classes
               - contains the __init__.py file which is the heart of the
                 application, contains the Celery configurations and creation
                 of Flask instance
      --- migrations - contains alembic and all Flask-Migration related files

     
      --- main.py - imports the create_app() from app/__init__.py
      

B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage

    --- celery_app.py - provides the Celery instance
    --- celery_config.py - provides the Celery configuration with the Flask instance
    --- manage.py - provides the Flask-Migrate implementation and setup
    
C. Database Configurations
   db_dump - contains the vrms_bcrypt.sql dump file, which contains dummy test data
           - database platform is PostgreSQL 

D. Dependencies
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch09-api-bcrypt-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency files
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

E. Running the application:
   --- Generate first the PostgreSQL table schema using the following Flask-Migrate commands:
         1. python -m flask --app manage.py db init
         2. python -m flask --app manage.py db migrate -m "Initial migration."
         3. python -m flask --app manage.py db upgrade
            python -m flask --app manage.py db downgrade (if schema needs update but modify the run_migrations_****() in env.py if necessary)
         4. (optional) python -m flask --app manage.py db histort 
         5. (optional) python -m flask --app manage.py db stamp head
   --- Run the Redis server first
   --- Open a new terminal in VS Code and using the ch05-api-bcrypt-env, run Celery at least using this command:
         celery -A main.celery_app worker --loglevel=info -P solo

   --- Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch09-api-bcrypt-env.
