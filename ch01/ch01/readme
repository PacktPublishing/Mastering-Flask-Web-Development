Project Name: Online Personnel Counselling System (OPCS)
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype is a web-based management system for people
 who seek help for mental health and behavioral concerns. The design leans towards an online helpdesk-type application with modules that cater to user management, patient monitoring using online written examinations to identify patient's problems, and managing the counselors.

 This first application does not follow any Flask standard in managing its source codes and files. It only uses a typical Flask implementation that
 runs any Flask components. The next chapter will provide the best practices for building Flask project directories that can help manage circular import errors..
========================================================================

A. Project Directory

--- ch01 (main project directory)
   --- config - contains the decorator for database connectivity 
              - by default, all db details are sifted from the .env file
   --- pages - contains the Jinja templates for the contents and error pages
   --- repository - contains the database transactions using the native psycopg2 driver 
   --- services - contains other Python transactions that utilize the repository for 
                  generate the proper response
   --- views - contains the Flask view functions showcasing different implementations 
               of managing request and response data
   --- converter - contains implementation for custom API types for Path variable types

   --- __init__.py file - contains the import that settles the circular import error when importing views in main.py

   --- main.py - the main module containing the Flask app instance and the setup initialization

   --- tests - the pytest folder containing test files for testing Flask components


B. Configuration files (choose only one)
    .env - the default configuration file
    .config.toml - configuration variables written in TOML (i.e., configure main.py to replace .env)
    .config.json - configuration variables written in JSON (i.e., configure main.py to replace .env)
    myconfig.py - configuration variables written using Python syntax (i.e., configure main.py to replace .env)


C. Database Configurations
   db_ dump - contains the opcs.sql dump file, which contains dummy test data

D. Dependencies
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch01-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency file.
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                          python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

E. Running the application:
   Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch01-env.
