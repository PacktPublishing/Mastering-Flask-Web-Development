Project Name: Online Library Management System (OLMS)
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype is an Online Library Management system 
        implemented using Flask, FastAPI, Django, and Tornado sub-applications 
        integrated into new technology solutions, such as Jaeger tool, GraphQL, 
        React, and Flutter.

A. Project Directory
--- ch12-microservices-interop (main project directory)
      --- modules  - the main Flask project
               - contains User modules
               - contains the repository with Peewee ORM
      -- modules_django - the Django sub-project that builds the student borrowe information
      -- modules_fastapi - the FastAPI sub-project that that builds the faculty borrower information
      -- modules_sub_flask - the Flask sub-project that builds the GraphQL application
      -- modules_tornado - the Tornado sub-porject that creates the welcome or home page.
      --- migrations - contains alembic and all Flask-Migration related files

      --- main_fastapi.py - creates the FastAPI instance for the FastAPI sub-project
      --- main_sub_flask.py - creates the Flask instance for the GraphQL application
      --- schema.graphql - the GraphQL definition file

B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage
    --- config_dev_sub.toml - the configuration variables for the Flask sub-application
    
    
C. Database Configurations
   db_dump - contains the ovs.sql dump file, which contains dummy test data
           - database platform is PostgreSQL 

D. Dependencies
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch12-microservices-interop-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency files
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

E. Running the application:
   --- Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch12-microservices-interop-env.
