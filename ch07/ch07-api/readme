Project Name: Tutor Finder application 
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype focuses on managing student and tutor profiles 
     and assigning or mapping them to each other. This experimental API-based 
     application uses different NoSQL databases to showcase how to integrate 
     NoSQL databases into Flask 3.x applications.

     The application uses the Application Factory design approach in managing 
     its source codes and directories.

A. Project Directory
--- ch07-api (main project directory)
      --- modules - contains all the API modules and their respective components
                  - the API modules are:
                     --- cassandra - contains the API endpoint functions that will use Cassandra
                     --- couchbase - contains the API endpoint functions for HBase
                     --- hbase - contains the API endpoints for HBase
                     --- mongo - contains the API endpoints for MongoDB
                     --- redis - contains the API endpoints for Redis
               - contains the model directory for each NoSQL database platform 
               - contains the repository directory for each NoSQL database platform
               - contains the __init__.py file which is the heart of the
                 application
                         --- all NoSQL database configurations are in __init__.py

      --- tests - contains the PyTest files for testing some components
      --- main.py - imports the create_app() from app/__init__.py
   

B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage
    
C. Database Configurations
   Hbase
       --- Use version 2.5.5

   Cassandra
       --- Use version 4.1.3 for Ubuntu distrib

   Redis
       --- Use version 7.2.3 for Ubuntu distrib
           or
           Use version 3.0.504 for Windows

   Mongo
       --- Use version 7.0 for Windows

   Couchbase
       --- Use version 7.2.0-5325 for Windows

D. Dependencies
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch07-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency files
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

E. Running the application:
   --- Start first ALL the NoSQL servers
   --- Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch07-env
