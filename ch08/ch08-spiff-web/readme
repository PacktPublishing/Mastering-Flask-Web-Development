Project Name: Doctor's Appointment Management Software (DAMS)
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype is a web application necessary 
       to simulate and run BPMN and non-BPMN workflows using SpiffWorkflow.

       The application uses the Blueprint and Application Factory design approach in managing its source codes and directories.
========================================================================

A. Project Directory

--- ch08-spiff-web (main project directory)
      --- modules  - contains all the  view modules and their respective components, 
                        such API endpoint functions, repository, and services
               - contains the model directory that has the model classes
               - contains the __init__.py - the heart of the applications
                     - contains all the initialization, setups, and   
                          configurations
                     - creates the Flask instance and returns it to main.py
              
      --- bpmn - the folder for BPMN files implementing the login, diagnosis, and
                 appointment workflows
      --- main.py -  the main module that imports the create_app() from 
          modules/__init__.py

      --- migrations - containing the Alembic-related files like the env.py


B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage
    --- celery_app.py - provides the Celery instance
    --- celery_config.py - provides the Celery configuration with the Flask instance
    --- manage.py - provides the Flask-Migrate implementation and setup
     
C. Database Configurations
   db_dump - contains the dams.sql dump file, which contains dummy test data
           - database platform is PostgreSQL 

D. Dependencies
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch08-spiff-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency file.
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

E. Running the application:
   --- Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch08-spiff-env.
