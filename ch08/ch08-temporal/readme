Project Name: Doctor's Appointment Management Software (DAMS)
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype is an API application necessary 
       to simulate and run workflows using Temporal.io.

       The application uses the Blueprint and Application Factory design approach in managing its source codes and directories.
========================================================================

A. Project Directory

--- ch08-temporal (main project directory)
      --- modules  - contains all the  API modules and their respective components, 
                        such API endpoint functions, repository, and services
             
               - contains the model directory that has the model classes
               - contains the __init__.py - the heart of the applications
                     - contains all the initialization, setups, and   
                          configurations
                     - creates the Flask instance and returns it to main.py
               - activities - contains the activities for each workflow
               - workflows - contains the workflow implementation

      --- main.py -  the main module that imports the create_app() from 
          modules/__init__.py


B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage
    --- celery_app.py - provides the Celery instance
    --- celery_config.py - provides the Celery configuration with the Flask instance
    --- manage.py - provides the Flask-Migrate implementation and setup
    --- run_worker.py - implements and creates a Temporal worker for the workflow
                execution
     
C. Database Configurations
   db_dump - contains the dams.sql dump file, which contains dummy test data
           - database platform is PostgreSQL 

D. Dependencies
   --- Generate first the PostgreSQL table schema using the following Flask-Migrate commands:
         1. python -m flask --app manage.py db init
         2. python -m flask --app manage.py db migrate -m "Initial migration."
         3. python -m flask --app manage.py db upgrade
            python -m flask --app manage.py db downgrade (if schema needs update but modify the run_migrations_****() in env.py if necessary)
         4. (optional) python -m flask --app manage.py db histort 
         5. (optional) python -m flask --app manage.py db stamp head
   --- Run the Redis server first
   --- Open a new terminal in VS Code and using the ch08-temporal-env, 
       run Celery at least using this command:
         celery -A main.celery_app worker --loglevel=info -P solo
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch08-temporal-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency file.
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

E. Running the application:
   --- Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch08-temporal-env.
