Project Name: Online Housing Prediction and Analysis System (OHPAS)
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype is a web-based scientific information management 
      system that uploads XLSX and CSV files with numerical and ordinal data 
      for analysis, computation, and report generation using graphs and plots.

      This application explores Flask's mathematical and scientific side with 
      popular modules like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, and other 
      related modules.
      The application uses Blueprint approach in managing its code structure.

A. Project Directory
--- ch0-web (main project directory)
      --- modules  - contains all the modules and their respective components, 
                        such view functions, repository, and services
                   - here are the modules:
                        - equations - contains form view accepting linear equations and
                                    derives the solutions
                        - external  - contains views that accesses Julia scripts for computation
                        - internal - contains views that uses Celery for computations
                        - realtime - contains WebSocket and SSE solutions for real-time data analysis
                        - rendition - contains views that generates plots and charts using front-end libraries
                        - upload - contains view that uploads XLSX and CSV files and generates data analysis and plotting

      --- Ch06JuliaPkg - Julia Packages
      --- Ch06JuliaTxPkg - Julia Packages
      --- exceptions - contains custom exceptions for the exception handlers
      --- files - folder for storing the uploaded files
      --- pages - Jinja templates for error pages
      --- templates - folder for saving generated PDF and LaTeX files
      --- tests - contains the PyTest files for testing some components
      --- main.py - creates the Flask instance, enables the
                    exception handlers, and sets up the Celery 
     
B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage
    --- celery_app.py - provides the Celery instance
    --- celery_config.py - provides the Celery configuration with the Flask instance
    --- redis_config.py - provides the configuration for the Redis server connectivity
    --- sock_config.py - creates the Sock instance from the Flask-Sock module for WebSocket

C. Database Configurations
   No database used.

D. Dependencies
   --- Install Julia language into the system. Make the julia command globally accessible
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch06-web-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency files
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

E. Running the application:
   --- Run the Redis server first
   --- Open a new terminal in VS Code and using the ch05-env, run Celery at least using this command:
         celery -A main.celery_app worker --loglevel=info -P solo
   --- Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch06-web-env
